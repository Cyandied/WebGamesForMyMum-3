# WebGames
My mum likes mastermind, but doesnt like ads, and did you know you can set up a webserver on an iphone? And even set it up so it auto-pulls from this very repository each time you open the webserver app? I sure didnt, but now I do, so now I create games for my mum she can play, 0 ads, 0 interupts, 100% fun!

Will mostly be puzzle games.
