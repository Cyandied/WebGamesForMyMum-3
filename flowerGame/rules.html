Flower game 

Brainstorm:
I want there to be some color mixing mechanincs
The games goal will be to deliver orders

Rules:
Set grid garden

Flowers can be placed freely but not removed

If two flowers are placed besides each other, they will combine and their colors will mix
x,x,x		x,x,x
f,f,x	->	x,f,x	
x,x,x		x,x,x
Flowers will always combine into the center

If two flowers are placed with one space between them, they will generate a new flower with petals chosen by the flowers position around the empty gridspace

Flowers have at least 3 and max 5 petals 
3 petals: 123	4 petals: 1234	5 petals: 12345
x,2,x		x,3,x		2,3,4
1,o,3		2,o,4		1,o,5
x,x,x		x,1,x		x,x,x

Flowers will always prioritize combining over generating a new flower

Player wins as soon as any flower(s) on the board fits the order given

Player is only given flowers is one of 5 primary colors, red, green, blue, black, white

Flowers can only be colored once per primary color, if a flower gets two of the same color, it disregards all other colors. So, flower of red - white, if combined with a red flower it becomes red - white - red = red flower.
1 exception: if black is applied to a flower with white in it, both will be removed, and vice versa
If a flower has more than one dupe color, ex red - red - green - green, it will prioritize as red - green - blue - black - white, where the first mention will be prioritized over the last mentioned
